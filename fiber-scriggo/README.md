# Scriggo template engine for Fiber

Scriggo is a template engine, to see the syntax documentation please [click here](https://scriggo.com/templates)

This is based off an [article](https://code.zikani.me/using-scriggo-templates-with-the-go-fiber-web-framework) I published on my [blog](https://code.zikani.me).

> NOTE: Do not use this in production. Look at Fiber's other [template engines](https://docs.gofiber.io/guide/templates)
